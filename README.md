# 📊 RetainX – Customer Retention & Churn Analytics Platform

RetainX is a full **end-to-end Customer Retention & Churn Analytics project** designed to replicate how analytics projects are executed in real organizations — from business understanding and data modeling to advanced analytics and executive dashboards.

The project focuses on identifying **churn drivers**, evaluating **customer health**, and quantifying **revenue at risk** using **SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI**.

---

## 🧠 Business Problem Statement

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges for subscription-based and service-driven businesses such as **Telecom, SaaS, OTT, and FinTech platforms**.

Losing customers not only impacts revenue but also increases customer acquisition costs and affects long-term growth. Organizations need a consolidated analytical view to proactively identify churn risks and take data-driven retention actions.

### Key business questions addressed:
- Why are customers churning?
- Which customers are at risk of churning?
- How does usage behavior affect churn?
- Which customer segments contribute most to revenue loss?
- Which geographic regions show higher churn patterns?

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior to understand churn patterns  
- Segment customers based on usage, tenure, and revenue  
- Identify **high-value customers at risk of churn**  
- Quantify **revenue at risk** due to churn  
- Build an **executive-ready Power BI dashboard** for decision-makers

## 🧩 Key Insights Generated

- Low-usage customers show significantly higher churn probability  
- Customers with longer tenure are more stable and less likely to churn  
- High-income customers churn less frequently but contribute the highest revenue loss when they do  
- Certain states consistently exhibit higher churn patterns  
- Targeting high-income, low-usage customers can significantly reduce revenue loss  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Introduce proactive retention strategies for low-usage customers  
- Focus churn-prevention efforts on high-income customer segments  
- Launch regional retention campaigns for high-churn states  
- Improve engagement through usage-based loyalty programs
